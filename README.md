# Project Proposal

## Project Title
### PricePath

## What and Why?
Track Prices on various online retail sites to compare and give discounts to users. 

Allows users to quickly scan through cheapest sites and obtain the best prices without scouring the internet. 

## For Whom?
For online shoppers, with a general focus on those that try to optimize to find the best price. 

## How?
Scrape prices from online retail sites (Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Etsy, Ebay, Target, Bestbuy, etc) and match identical goods, then rank them. Keep track of prices and fluctuations over time, display them to users with a link to where to buy. This is the Core Feature of the website. 

Website can also be expanded upon to include user logins to allow for notifications when their favorited products have discounts, though this is not necessary for the website to function. 

Idealy the view -> buy process should also be made as simple as possible, without the user creating a new account for every new website, though this may be difficult to accomplish. 

## Scope
I believe the Core scope will be relatively achievable. The main technical aspects will come from scrapping product listings from websites and reposting them. However, there is still a challenging aspect in automatically matching products correctly and properly scrapping the websites. The rest is simply storage and display. 

Outside of the Core features, creating user accounts also shouldn't be too difficult, though it does require some security features. 

Adding quick purchasing options will, however, be difficult. Although this feature is not necessary for the core project to function, it would be a nice addition to create a smoother user experience.
